# Java Data Structures Repository

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures, such as linked lists, graphs, binary trees, hash tables, stacks, queues, and heaps.

## Data Structures Included

- **Linked List:** You can find both singly linked list and doubly linked list implementations in this repository.

- **Graph:** We provide implementations for directed and undirected graphs.

- **Binary Tree:** This includes binary search trees and binary heaps.

- **Hash Table:** A basic hash table implementation is available.

- **Stack:** A simple stack data structure is included.

- **Queue:** A basic queue data structure is provided.

- **Heap:** A binary heap implementation for maintaining maximum or minimum elements efficiently.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to access the data structure implementations. Feel free to explore, modify, or integrate them into your Java projects.
